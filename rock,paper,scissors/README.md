## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
*This Python script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game 
where the player faces off against a computer opponent. The player
chooses either Rock (r), Paper (p), or Scissors (s), and the 
computer makes a random choice. The game then determines the winner 
based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.*
### Sample run
```
Enter 'r' for Rock, 's' for scissors, 'p' for paper: r
Player:r Opponent:p
Opponent wins
```
